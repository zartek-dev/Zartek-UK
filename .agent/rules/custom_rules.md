# Workspace Rules - Zartek UK

## GitHub Auto-Push
Every time a design is successfully implemented from Stitch or a component is updated:
1.  **Immediate Commit & Push**: Use GitHub MCP tools (`mcp_github_push_files`) to push the changes directly to the `main` branch of `zartek-dev/Zartek-UK`.
2.  **No Permission Required**: Proceed with the push automatically after implementation.
3.  **Reporting**: Report the commit hash and result in the `walkthrough.md`.
